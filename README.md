This is the 1.19 version of the PlayerHealthIndicators mod

This version undo's a patch made on the original mod which hides hearts for invisible players
This was considered a bug but has become useful to detect invisible players and their locations or to prevent accidentally hitting invisible players

It also implements the patch that stacks hearts in rows instead of displaying it in a single row


Single row display
